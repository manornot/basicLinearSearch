# Task 9: Basic Linear Search

## Objective
Write a C program that implements a basic linear search algorithm to find a specific integer in an array. The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array, then the elements of the array, followed by the number they wish to search for within the array. If the number is found, the program should print the index at which it was found; otherwise, it should print a message indicating that the number is not in the array.

## Requirements
- The program must be written in C.
- Prompt the user to enter the size of the array, followed by the elements of the array, and finally the number to search for.
- Implement the linear search algorithm to find the specified number in the array.
- If the number is found, print: `Number found at index: X`, where X is the index of the number.
- If the number is not found, print: `Number not found in the array.`
- Assume that array indices start at 0.

## Example Input/Output

Enter the size of the array: 5 <br />
Enter the elements of the array: 1 2 3 4 5 <br />
Enter the number to search for: 3 <br />
Number found at index: 2 <br />

Enter the size of the array: 4 <br />
Enter the elements of the array: 7 8 9 10 <br />
Enter the number to search for: 5 <br />
Number not found in the array. <br />

## Submission Guidelines
- Name your C source file as `linear_search.c`.
- Your code should be well-commented, explaining the logic behind your implementation of the linear search algorithm.
- Push your program to your assigned GitHub repository before the deadline.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness: The program correctly identifies whether the number is in the array and outputs the appropriate message.
- Code Quality: The code is clean, efficient, and well-commented.
- Adherence to the submission guidelines.
